# Overview
Generic C2 PQ-safe cryptographic transport protocol intended to protect against powerful wire attackers, with a rust reference implementation. This repo contains two things:
- a protocol specification, with an associated threat model
- a reference implementation

## What this is not
A C2 transport protocol. This protocol is only concerned with cryptographically protecting the data transmitted between a beacon and its server. It does not know anything about how data should be transported or where. Therefore, the intent is for this protocol to be used in a way that ryhmes with this:
```c++
class transport {
    // ...
    std::vector<uint8_t> network_send(const uint8_t* ptr, size_t len);
    // ...
};

bool transport::send(const std::span<const uint8_t> data) {
    uint8_t* encrypted_ptr = nullptr;
    size_t encrypted_len = 0;
    size_t encrypted_capa = 0;
    if (encrypt_to_server(data.data(), data.size(), encrypted_ptr, encrypted_len, encrypted_capa) == 0) {
        auto response = this->network_send(encrypted_ptr, encrypted_len);
        free_vec(encrypted_ptr, encrypted_len, encrypted_capa);
        // ...
    }
    return false;
}
```

In essence, this **only** handles crypto, you still get to do whatever you want on the transport side.

## Limitations
In short: PQ algorithms take a lot more space than classical ones. This is unfortunately unavoidable. Therfore, the initial registration handshake will be somewhat large (~2.2kb for ML-KEM). However, this does not impact any follow on messages, for which the only overhead is the captn' proto framing.

The reference implementation is large, ~6.5MB for the static lib. It goes down to ~3.5MB if building the stdlib ourselves with a nightly toolchain. This is largely due to the fact that we need to bring a bunch of rust stuff with us. Unfortunately, most crypto libraries aren't really meant to run in 40KB images, so there's always going to be some floor there. It should however be easy to cut the rust-related stuff by implementing this protocol in C or C++, though you'll still have to pay for the libsodium + captn proto libraries.

The C interfaces are probably not thread safe.

# TODOs
Test the C interface
Make the server usable

# Reference implementation
I don't use rust a lot, so the code is probably fairly naive. It provides both a beacon and server implementation with C bindings through `cbindgen`. Ideally more bindings would be built on top of that so it can be used in the mythic server-side.
